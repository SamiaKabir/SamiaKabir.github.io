summary: "In this project, we investigated how including explanations and their level of meaningfulness would influence users' trust and perceptions of accuracy. We studied these issues by conducting a controlled experiment using a localized explanation approach in the context of image classification."

## Overview

Machine learning and AI can aid human decision-making, but trust and comprehension are key factors. Researchers have explored explainable interfaces to clarify system outputs. However, the impact of meaningful vs. meaningless explanations, especially for non-experts, remains unclear. We conducted a controlled image classification experiment with local explanations. Results reveal that the human meaningfulness of explanations significantly affects accuracy perception. Weak, less human-meaningful explanations led to underestimation of system accuracy. This underscores the importance of human-understandable rationale in user judgments of intelligent systems.
